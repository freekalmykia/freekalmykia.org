The Free Kalmykia Foundation offers partial reimbursements for DNA tests that support genealogical, historical, and cultural research related to Oirats and Kalmyks. This program is intended to make lineage testing more accessible while inviting participants to make their results publicly viewable to support independent research.

## Eligible Tests & Reimbursement Amounts

Only tests from 23andMe or FamilyTreeDNA qualify:

- 23andMe — Ancestry or Ancestry + Health tests: up to $50 reimbursement
- FamilyTreeDNA — Family Ancestry test: up to $50 reimbursement
- FamilyTreeDNA Big Y-700 test only: $250 reimbursement

Lower-level FamilyTreeDNA Y-DNA tests, such as Y-37 or Y-111, are not eligible. Eligible haplogroups for Big Y-700 test: C3, O, N3, R2a-M124, J-L581

## Requirements

- Applicants must provide their ethnic group and house within the Oirat-Kalmyk people.
- Test results must be made publicly viewable on GEDMatch or FamilyTreeDNA.
- Applications must include proof of purchase and proof of public access.
- Send applications to <board@freekalmykia.org>

## Funding Limit

Funds for this program are limited. Applications will be processed in the order received and reimbursed only while funds are available. New funds will be allocated each year, allowing the program to continue on an annual basis.

## Purpose

This program supports the long-term effort to improve the availability of open-source Oirat-Kalmyk lineage data for historical and anthropological research. It also reflects the Foundation’s broader mission to preserve and advance knowledge of Oirat-Kalmyk origins, language, and culture.

## Privacy and Data Use

The Foundation does not collect, store, or analyze any genetic data from participants. The Foundation’s role is limited to reviewing eligibility and processing reimbursements.
